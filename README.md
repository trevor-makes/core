core is a framework for building rich microcontroller applications.

This package is intended to be used with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), but the source files can be manually copied into a project when using the Arduino IDE.

To add core to an existing PlatformIO project, modify the `platformio.ini` configuration file as follows:

```
lib_deps =
